  * Key Learning Outcomes
    * Visualise mutational signatures present in a cohort using somatic single nucleotide mutation data in Variant Call Format (vcf) files.
    * Compare analysis output with published results to identify common mutational signatures.
    * Have gained overview knowledge of how somatic signatures can help with cohort cancer analysis.
	* Run the IntOGen analysis software on cohort mutation data.
    * Have gained experience of the structure of the analysis output files in order to identify potential driver genes.
    * Have gained overview knowledge of different methods for identification of genes important in cancers.
